The first app is a hashing tool app which is a simple Python program that generates a SHA-256 hash for either a user-entered string or the contents of a file. When run, it lets you choose whether to hash text or a file, then calculates a unique 64-character hexadecimal value that represents the input data. This hash value acts like a digital fingerprint. If even one character or byte in the original data changes, the resulting hash will be completely different. The app demonstrates how hashing ensures data integrity and is commonly used in password storage, file verification, and digital security systems, all while keeping the process easy to understand and use from the command line.

The second app is a Caesar Cipher app is a simple Python program that demonstrates one of the earliest forms of encryption by shifting each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. Users can choose to encrypt or decrypt text, enter a custom shift value (the key), and see the transformed result instantly. Letters wrap around the alphabet (so “Z” shifted by 1 becomes “A”), while non-letter characters like spaces and punctuation remain unchanged. This makes the app a clear, hands-on example of how substitution ciphers work—illustrating the basic principles of symmetric encryption, where the same key is used to both scramble and unscramble the message.

The last app is a simple digital signing and verification tool that demonstrates how public-key cryptography works without relying on OpenSSL. It uses the cryptography library to generate an RSA key pair, then allows you to sign text or files with the private key and verify their authenticity with the public key. The app can be run interactively or from the command line, showing the full process of creating secure Base64-encoded signatures and confirming whether data has been tampered with. It provides a clear, practical example of how digital signatures ensure data integrity and authenticity in a modern, easy-to-understand way.

To run any of the apps simply type python <appName.py> in the terminal and follow the instructions.
